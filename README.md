# Kinetic Monte Carlo
The English Wiki page is pretty good to learn most important stuff on the implementation
## Usage
There is a test which can be used as example and a skeleton which you can copy as a starting point
## Development
I have no idea what state will this engine end up in in the end, but I mostly need motivation to continue it. If you have any suggestions tell me and I'll gladly implement them. Hopefully one day it'll have a patch 1.0
### numba

```bash
if you don't like / don't want numba just remove all imports and "@njit"s
```
